    "Scientific imaging typically requires quantitative measures. “Images are numbers” and those numbers are often significant to scientific questions. Often image values obtained by a camera are expressed in Arbitrary Digital Units (ADU), which are a function of the input light, detector sensitivity and conversion factors, and analog-to-digital conversion. You have already seen that you have a 10-bit camera whose values attain a maximum of 1023. However, scientifically, these values tend not to have a lot of absolute meaning without additional calibration. Similarly, the size and sampling of your image are dependent on how you have set up your optical system. In the following portions of the lab, you will calibrate ADU to have a scientific meaning (transmissivity) as well as establish the size and sampling of your image (so that you can label the actual sizes of features in your image).\n",
