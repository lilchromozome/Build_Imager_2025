    "We are going to use the same kind of procedure as outlined above to find out certain parameters in a physical microscope system. To do this we need a functional form of our data simulator. Specifically, you need to convert the simulation code you wrote from Part 1 of this lab to a function called `make_psf`. The inputs to the function are radius of the exit pupil (`r`), coefficients to the Zernike polynomials (`coefs`) that define any system aberrations, the corresponding mode indices of the Zernike polynomials (`mode_indices`), and size of the PSF you want to make (`nxy`). The output of the function should be a simulated PSF. For example, you should be able to execute the following command:\n",

    "`def make_psf(r, coefs, mode_indices, nxy):` <br/>\n",
